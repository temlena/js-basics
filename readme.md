6. Statically typed languages have better performance at run-time and are faster at run-time. It is because there is no need for type checking at run-time, and the code has already been translated.But dynamically-typed languages are comparatively faster during development time and are more flexible. 
Statically typed languages perform type checking at compile-time, while dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at run-time. 
Statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not.
 Examples of dynamically-typed language include; Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, R, Dart, Lua, Objective-C, etc. Exaamples of statiscally typed languages include; Java, C, C++, C#, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Pascal, Rust, Go, COWhenBOL, etc.
 7. a value is not assigned to a variable, the value is undefined and if a function is not returning anything, it remains undefined. While null in javascript means an empty value.
